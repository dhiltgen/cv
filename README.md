# cv
Image detection tools for security cameras

At the moment, this has a very rudimentary python script that leverages
[Darknet Yolo](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet) and opencv to process
one or more videos and figure out if any objects are detected.  This is
pacaged to run as a Docker Container to make it a little easier to get
all the bits and pieces built on various systems.
